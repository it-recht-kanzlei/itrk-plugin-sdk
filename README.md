# Interface specification for the transfer of legal texts from IT-Recht Kanzlei MÃ¼nchen to your system

Data is pushed to your interface via POST in XML format. The document is UTF-8 encoded. 
The POST parameter is "xml" by default (`$_POST['xml']`), other agreements are possible.

## Implementation and use of the PHP SDK

We offer a PHP SDK for users of our IT law firm interface. The SDK is designed for easy use.
First, the two abstract methods of the class **LTIHandler** class and one of the
two authentication methods must be overwritten.

### Creation of your own LTI handler

#### Authentication methods

To ensure that the transfer of the legal texts originates from the 
IT-Recht Kanzlei system, you can implement one of the following two methods.

##### isTokenValid(string $token): bool

The validity of the transmitted token must be checked here if the system should work with a token.
The token is generated manually by you or automatically by your system and stored
in the client portal of IT-Recht Kanzlei during configuration of the interface
by the user of the interface.This is the preferred authentication method.

##### validateUserPass(string $username, string $password): bool

The correctness of a transmitted user name and password must be checked here.
The user name and password can be assigned by the users themselves in your plugin
or can be created by your plugin. The user name and password must then be stored
in the client portal when setting up the interface.

#### handleActionGetAccountList(): LTIAccountListResult

This function should return a list of all sales channels in your system.
An ID (`accountid`) and the name (`accountname`) must be specified for each
sales channel. In addition, a list of available target languages can be
transferred for each sales channel.

Even if your system is not a multishop system, it is recommended to implement
this function to announce the supported target languages of your system. For
this use case, only one sales channel needs to be specified where the ID is
specified as `0`. The account name can remain empty.

Important: Please ensure that these 5 special XML characters are replaced by
corresponding entities in the names of the sales channels (`accountname`):

```
& => &amp;
< => &lt;
> => &gt;
" => &quot;
' => &apos;
```

#### handleActionPush(LTIPushData $data): LTIPushResult

Once the request has been received by the plugin, the document must be
integrated into the corresponding target page. The document is processed here.
The `LTIPushData` object has getter methods for all properties of the document
that can be queried and subsequently processed.

### Use of the LTI class and the LTI handler you have implemented.

The class `LTI` (`LTI.php`) takes over the preprocessing of the incoming XML data,
evaluates the action to be executed and carries out most of the error handling.
This file should not be changed to ensure that the SDK remains fully functional.

The constructor of the LTI class requires three parameters.

1. An instance of your overwritten LTIHandler class
2. The version of the system that is addressed with your implementation
3. The version of your implementation in which the SDK is used

The last step is to call the `handleRequest()` method of the LTI class object.
For this purpose, `$_POST['xml']` can be used directly as a parameter.

Both error handling within the SDK and the preparation of the response for the
IT-Recht Kanzlei server are handled automatically by the SDK.
The developer can ignore these aspects.

An example implementation of the SDK is included in the supplied example.php file.

## General

### Versioning

Requirements for the processing of version numbers by the client portal of IT-Recht Kanzlei:

* `meta_modulversion`: Assign incrementing version numbers for your
  implementation when you first create it and for each subsequent update.
* `meta_shopversion`: If possible, please also transmit a system version number
  that can be compared using comparison operators (e.g. "2.0" instead of
  "XY2" - otherwise by request). Please let us know the structure of your
  versioning scheme (e.g. "major.minor") so that we can process it correctly
  internally.

### Multishop systems

If your system is a so-called multishop system, i.e. several sales channels/services
exist under one administration interface, it is necessary that the user of your
implementation is offered a list of available sales channels/services for which
the legal texts are to be transferred in the client portal of the IT law firm.

The list of sales channels is retrieved using the function `handleActionGetAccountList()`.

With the subsequent "push", the `accountid` selected by the user is transmitted
in the XML element `user_account_id` for multishop systems.

### Best Practices

* Assign proper numerical, incrementing version numbers (e.g. "1.0", "1.1", "1.2", ...)
  for your module when it is first created and for each subsequent update. In
  addition to classic version numbers, the release date can also be used
  numerically here (e.g. "20230827", format YYYYMMDD). Always state the current
  version number in the documentation / installation instructions supplied with
  the module and at least in the main program file.
* Include easy-to-understand installation instructions with your module download
  or on the download page. Include special cases in your description
  (e.g. for older store versions).
* Include a description for the user of new versions of your implementation (updates)
  on how to update to the latest version (this often differs from the classic
  installation instructions), unless the update runs automatically
  (e.g. by clicking on "Update" in the store's module store).
* Include a changelog.txt or similar with new releases of your implementation (updates)
  to inform the user about the new features and bug fixes.

## Testing

To test your implementation of the interface, please read the README.md
in the **testSuite** directory.


An additional tool you can use for testing is the
[LTI Test Tool](https://www.it-recht-kanzlei.de/developer/sdk.php).
There you can enter the API URL and the authentication data for your test
system and execute requests with the legal text interface of the IT-Recht Kanzlei.

## Details of the implementation within the SDK

If you cannot or do not want to use the SDK, you will find some details below
that could be helpful for your own implementation.

### XML elements, [data type] and (possible values):

* api_version [string]

  Version number of the interface (e.g. "1.0")

* user_auth_token [string]

  Is generated by your system and can also be found there. Used for authentication.

* action [string] (`push` | `getaccountlist` | `version`)

  "`version`" only returns the store version, module version and PHP version installed on the system.
  PHP version installed on the system.

  "`getaccountlist`" lists all sales channels and their supported languages.

  "`push`" is the command for transferring a legal text.

* user_account_id [string]

  is only set for multishop systems if a list of sales channels has previously
  been retrieved using the `getaccountlist` action and a selection has been made
  by the client.

---

* rechtstext_type [string] (impressum | agb | datenschutz | widerruf )

  Type of legal text transferred
  - impressum = imprint
  - agb = general terms and conditions
  - datenschutz = privacy policy
  - widerruf = cancellation policy

* rechtstext_title [string]

  Title of the translated legal text in the original language

* rechtstext_text [text]

  Text variant of the legal text

* rechtstext_pdf [text]

  PDF version of the legal text

* rechtstext_html [text]

  HTML version of the legal text

* rechtstext_country [string]

  ISO 3166-1-alpha-2, country, e.g. "DE" for Germany, is transmitted uppercase

* rechtstext_language [string]

  ISO 639-1, language of the legal text, e.g. "de" for German, is transmitted lowercase

* rechtstext_language_iso639_2b [string]

  ISO 639-2 bibliographic code (B code), language of the legal text, e.g. "ger" for German,
  lowercase

### Status codes

* **success:** Everything went well. You confirm,
    * that no errors occurred when querying the version
    * that no errors occurred when querying the account list
    * that when a legal text was pushed, it was successfully published in the user's account/shop
* **error:** Regardless of the error code, the status of the error response will always be "error".

### Error codes

The error codes are documented in the LTIError.php file. If possible, please
only use the error codes defined in the file. Avoid using the error code 99 as
much as possible. You can define your own error codes with the number
range >= 100. Please inform IT-Recht Kanzlei of the error code and its meaning.
Error codes for other generic errors can also be added to the number
range < 100 by agreement.
